# Arduino sketches

## HumTemPol.pde
You'll have to adapt this sketch to your arduino board and get the
Adafruit DHT11 libs. Of course, you'll also need an arduino compatible
board with a plugged-in DHT11 (watch the pin config)

## AutoPlug.pde
The build for my power box will require further explanation, but in
short: this is a sketch that controls a relay board.
