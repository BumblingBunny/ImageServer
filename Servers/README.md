## plugd
This talks to an arduino sketch which controls what must be one of the
most implemented practical projects: a controlled multi-plug. The
protocol is ad-hoc and simple

## dht11
Talks to a very basic sketch which regularly reads from a DHT-11
sensor, caches the result and relays that information on via TCP.
