# (Image)Server

Originally intended to just serve up pictures from the camera (hence
the ImageServer moniker) this has since grown a bit and now acts as an
image server, a web interface for the power box and simple file server
to serve MRTG data. It also serves up Humidity/Temperature (called
hum_tem throughout) data as plain text.
